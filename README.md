# CocoaLumberjack at Salesforce

This repo merely serves as an Xcode static library project around [the CocoaLumberjack project](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaLumberjack).  This is mainly so we can separate CocoaLumberjack as an independent dependency, allowing other developers the flexibility to remove our version and provide their own implementation of CocoaLumberjack in their apps.
